# SQL OR Operator

## The SQL OR Operator

The `WHERE` clause can contain one or more `OR` operators.

The `OR` operator is used to filter records based on more
than one condition, like if you want to return all customers
from Germany but also those from Spain:

> Select all customers from Germany or Spain:

```sql
SELECT *
    FROM Customers
    WHERE Country = 'Germany' 
    OR Country = 'Spain';
```

##  Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;
```

##  OR vs AND

The `OR` operator displays a record if `any` of the conditions are `TRUE`.

The `AND` operator displays a record if `all` the conditions are `TRUE`.

## Demo Database

Below is a selection from the Customers table used in the examples:

| CustomerID |            CustomerName            |     ContactName    |            Address            |     City    | PostalCode | Country |
|:----------:|:----------------------------------:|:------------------:|:-----------------------------:|:-----------:|:----------:|:-------:|
| 1          | Alfreds Futterkiste                | Maria Anders       | Obere Str. 57                 | Berlin      | 12209      | Germany |
| 2          | Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados | Ana Trujillo       | Avda. de la Constitución 2222 | México D.F. | 05021      | Mexico  |
| 3          | Antonio Moreno Taquería            | Antonio Moreno     | Mataderos 2312                | México D.F. | 05023      | Mexico  |
| 4          | Around the Horn                    | Thomas Hardy       | 120 Hanover Sq.               | London      | WA1 1DP    | UK      |
| 5          | Berglunds snabbköp                 | Christina Berglund | Berguvsvägen 8                | Luleå       | S-958 22   | Sweden  |

##  At Least One Condition Must Be True

The following SQL statement selects all fields from Customers where
either `City` is "Berlin", `CustomerName` starts with the letter "G"
`or` `Country` is "Norway":

```sql
SELECT * 
    FROM Customers
    WHERE City = 'Berlin' 
    OR CustomerName LIKE 'G%' 
    OR Country = 'Norway';
```

##  Combining AND and OR

You can combine the `AND` and `OR` operators.

The following SQL statement selects all customers from Spain that
starts with a "G" or an "R".

**Make sure you use parenthesis to get the correct result.**

> Select all Spanish customers that starts with either "G" or "R":

```sql
SELECT * 
    FROM Customers
    WHERE Country = 'Spain' 
    AND (CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%');
```

Without parenthesis, the select statement will return all customers
from Spain that starts with a "G", plus all customers that starts with
an "R", regardless of the country value:

> Select all customers that either:
>
>- are from Spain and starts with either "G",
>- orstarts with the letter "R":

```sql
SELECT * 
    FROM Customers
    WHERE Country = 'Spain' 
    AND CustomerName LIKE 'G%' 
    OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%';
```
